These scripts were written by Siavash Mirarab and are based on tools by M.N. Price obtained at this website:

http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/treecmp.html

First download the folder tree_comp_morgan, compareTrees, compareTrees.missingBranch, 
and compareTrees.missingBranchRate to the same folder from which you want to do your calculations. 

Then, set file permissions (e.g. chmod 755) to make the scripts compareTrees, compareTrees.missingBranch, 
and compareTrees.missingBranchRate executable. 

usage: if <tree1> and <tree2> are paths to tree files in newick format, then 

./compareTrees <tree1> <tree2> 

will output a lot of information about the two trees. 

./compareTrees.missingBranch <tree1> <tree2>

will output 3 numbers: 

b1 b2 1-b2/b1

where b1 is the number of nontrivial splits displayed by tree1, b2 is the number of splits in tree1 that are displayed by tree2

and for accuracy the most common usage is

./compareTrees.missingBranchRate referencetree estimatedtree

will output the percentage of branches missing in the estimated tree that appear in the referencetree, e.g. referencetree is <tree1> 
and estimatedtree is <tree2>
