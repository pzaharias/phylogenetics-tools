To use these tools, download the whole quartets folder that contains this README

the usage for quartet-controller is:

./quartet-controller.sh <treesfile> <quartetfrequencies>

where <treesfile> is a file containing a collection of trees in newick format, and <quartetfrequencies> is the name of the output file in which each line is a quartet induced by the trees in <treesfile> and the number of times it appears in the trees in <treesfile>
