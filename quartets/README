The tools in this folder are all based on tools from the reference 

    
Johansen, J.: Computing triplet and quartet distances. PhD thesis, Aarhus University, Computer Science Department (2013), which can be found online at the link

To use these tools, download the whole quartets folder that contains this README

the usage for quartet-controller.sh is:

./quartet-controller.sh <treesfile> <quartetfrequencies>

where <treesfile> is a file containing a collection of trees in newick format, and <quartetfrequencies> is the name of the output file in which each line is a quartet induced by the trees in <treesfile> and the number of times it appears in the trees in <treesfile>  

The usage for calculate_weight.sh is

./calculate_weight.sh <treesfile> <quartetscores> 

where <treesfile> is a file containing a collection of trees in newick format, and <quartetscores> is a list of quartets induced by the trees in <treesfile> paired with the the number of times it appears in the trees in <treesfile>: the key difference between quartet-controller.sh and calculate_weight.sh is that the file <quartetscores> is formatted as input to wQMC (provided the taxon names are integers-wQMC required taxon names to be integers).
