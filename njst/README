This folder contains a package for running NJst, the method from the paper 
Liu, L., Yu, L.: Estimating species trees from unrooted gene trees. Syst. Biol. 60, 661â€“667 (2011)
using R.  This package will run on a linux machine only.  You must have R version 3.1.2 installed, as well as the R packages Matrix, methods, ape, and phybase. 

First, unzip the file njst.zip to create a folder called njst-package.  In this folder there will be various files, including a shell script called njst.sh

Change the permissions for this file chmod 755 njst.sh

Then

Usage is:  ./njst inputfile outputfile 

Where inputfile is the path the inputfile of gene trees from which you want to infer a species tree, and outputfile is the path to the outputfile where you want the package to write the output of NJst
